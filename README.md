# Vanadium-Redox-Battery
Starting a 2-year project. Nice to meet ya!
My name is Nicolas Garcia and i'm a junior student at Universidad Tecnol√≥gica Nacional. This repository will aim to acquire information about vanadium batteries. We will work with open-source software, like Code-Aster and OpenFoam. Every piece of information you drop here will be welcome.
